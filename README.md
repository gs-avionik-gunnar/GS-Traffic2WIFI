# GS-Traffic2WIFI
GS-Traffic2Wifi Software is a stripped down fork of [ESP32-Serial-Bridge](https://github.com/AlphaLima/ESP32-Serial-Bridge) with some specific tweaks and extensions.
GS-Traffic2WIFI is the default Soft-/Firmware of the GS-Traffic2Wifi-Kits, available on [gs-avionik.de](https://www.gs-avionik.de) but will also work with any ESP32-Module with an attached TTL/RS232-Converter on GPIO21 and GPIO01.

## Versions
Softwareversion 1.1 is stable and proved reliable. Versions beetween 1.1 and 2.0 are beta-versions, which aren't tested well and may be buggy. Next stable release will be Version 2.0. Impovements of 2.0 will be
- Webgui (http://192.168.1.1) for configuring GS-Traffic2WIFI
- Status pages and basic code for extracting and interpreting received NMEA-data
- Configurable baud-rates and tcp-ports
- Configurable SSID / WPA-Key
- Power-Reducing-Mode for Wifi
- NMEA-GRPMC-Fake for testing (only one dummy message)


You can see some videos of GS-Traffic2WIFI on my [Youtube-Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv42FT93emRBfOEssAWbdOw)

The generated SSID and WIFI-Key is part of the unique MAC of the ESP32. The SSID contains the last 4 digits of the mac-adress with a prefix of "GS-Traffic-". The Key is generated by the last 8 digits of the mac-adress.
