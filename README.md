# GS-Traffic2WIFI
GS-Traffic is a serial-wife-bridge with some specific features for NMEA-/Flarm-devices. You can use it for connecting your moving-map-software to your Flarm- or GPS-device.
GS-Traffic2Wifi Software 1.0 and 1.1 was a stripped down fork of [ESP32-Serial-Bridge](https://github.com/AlphaLima/ESP32-Serial-Bridge). With Version 2.0 there are a lot of extensions and the codebase is reworked in most parts. Version 2.0 offers a WebUI for configuring the device. GS-Traffic2WIFI is the default Soft-/Firmware of the GS-Traffic2Wifi-Kits, available on [gs-avionik.de](https://www.gs-avionik.de) but will also work with any ESP32-Module with an attached TTL/RS232-Converter on GPIO21 and GPIO01. Since Version 2.0 RPIO19 is used as a factory-reset when connected to GND and startup.

## Versions
Version 2.2 is now stable and offers some additional features:
- Added experimental Client-Mode for Wifi and TCP-Bridging
- Added code for dualcolor LED on GPIO18 and GPIO5 for status of the module and/or Traffic-Warning (Configurable based on $PFLAU)
- Added baud rates: 115.200 and 230.400

Version 2.1 is now stable and offers some additional features:
- Added extracting data from $GPGSA and $PGRMZ messages

Version 2.0 is now stable and offers some additional features like:
- Webgui (http://192.168.1.1) for configuring GS-Traffic2WIFI
- Status pages and basic code for extracting and interpreting received NMEA-data
- Configurable baud-rates and tcp-ports
- Configurable SSID / WPA-Key
- Power-Reducing-Mode for Wifi
- NMEA-GRPMC-Fake for testing (only one dummy message)

Softwareversion 1.1 was the first offical release and was shipped with GS-Traffic2WIFI Modules offered by [gs-avionik.de](https://www.gs-avionik.de).

## Instructions for factory reset
For resetting the device to default please connect PIN 19 to GND and reboot the unit. After one second please disconnect and reboot again. The device is now on default-settings.
The generated SSID and WIFI-Key is part of the unique MAC of the ESP32. The SSID contains the last 4 digits of the mac-adress with a prefix of "GS-Traffic-". The Key is generated by the last 8 digits of the mac-adress.

## Instructions for installing on blank device (or updating from Version 1.1)
On Windows, MacOS and Linux use can use [ESPHOME-Flasher] (https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/releases/) for loading the firmware. Just connect the ESP32 via Micro-USB to your computer, start the ESPHOME-Flaser, select the COM-Port and select the latest binary of GS-Traffic2WIFI (GS-Traffic2WIFI-version2.1.bin)
