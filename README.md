# GS-Traffic2WIFI
GS-Traffic2Wifi Software is a stripped down fork of [ESP32-Serial-Bridge](https://github.com/AlphaLima/ESP32-Serial-Bridge) with some specific tweaks and extensions.
GS-Traffic2WIFI is the default Soft-/Firmware of the GS-Traffic2Wifi-Kits, available on [gs-avionik.de](https://www.gs-avionik.de) but will also work with any ESP32-Module with an attached TTL/RS232-Converter on GPIO21 and GPIO01.

You can see some videos of GS-Traffic2WIFI on my [Youtube-Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv42FT93emRBfOEssAWbdOw)

The generated SSID and WIFI-Key is part of the unique MAC of the ESP32. The SSID contains the last 4 digits of the mac-adress with a prefix of "GS-Traffic-". The Key is generated by the last 8 digits of the mac-adress.

Feel free to modify and contribute!
